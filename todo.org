* The whole thing
  Done creating an oscillator.
  I'll work on adding knobs for the gui.
  Also I want to try to create a plugin just as a test run so I can learn how.
  Honestly not too excited by the thing in its current state.
  It does look kinda cool though but sounds pretty boring.

* Polynomial interpolation in the tick function?
  Possibly lead to smooth sound. Currently sounds kinda harsh and idk why.
  I think I tried this actually year ago in the original synth code and it wasn't very itneresting.
