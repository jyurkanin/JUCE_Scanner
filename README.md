Here's a little demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqG8BO8KsBE
Just click "open waveform" and pick your favorite single cycle waveform to load into the plugin.
Also, set the glide around .8. I should have picked a better default.

This works by simulating the wave in the table according to the wave equation. So it's like a string, with stiffness and damping terms.
This technique is sometimes called scanned synthesis and honestly it's kinda underwhelming, but the visual is cool. The bass notes can sound pretty good though.
